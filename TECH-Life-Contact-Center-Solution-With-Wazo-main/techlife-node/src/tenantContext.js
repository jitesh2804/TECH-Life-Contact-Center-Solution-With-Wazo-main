/**
 * Reseller / Sub-Tenant isolation with strict boundary enforcement.
 *
 * A tenant admin normally operates on their own tenant only. A
 * 'reseller' tenant's admin may additionally switch into and manage any
 * of ITS OWN sub-tenants (tenants.parent_tenant_id = the reseller's own
 * id) -- never another reseller's sub-tenants, never an unrelated
 * tenant. This is the single choke point every admin route uses to
 * determine which tenant_id to read/write; no route computes this
 * itself, so the isolation rule can't be forgotten on one page.
 *
 * Mounted after requireRole(['admin','superadmin']) in routes/admin.js.
 * Populates:
 *   req.effectiveTenant     -- the tenant row currently being managed
 *   req.manageableTenants   -- [own tenant, ...own sub-tenants] -- the
 *                              only tenants this admin is ever allowed
 *                              to switch into
 *   res.locals.effectiveTenant / res.locals.manageableTenants -- same,
 *                              for the sidebar tenant switcher
 *
 * Switching tenant context happens via ?as_tenant=<id> on any admin
 * route; the choice is remembered in the session and re-validated
 * against req.manageableTenants on every request (so a stale/tampered
 * session value can never grant access to a tenant outside the
 * allowed set -- if the id in session isn't in manageableTenants this
 * request, it's silently ignored and the admin's own tenant is used).
